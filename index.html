                <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2><br>
                <p>If you want to know things about me that are beyond the scope of my resume, you've come to the right place.
                    I won't try to explain my personality in a few words, people are too complex for that.
                    Instead, I'll tell you what I enjoy doing.</p><br>
                <p>I enjoy programming, but I also enjoy doing many other things.
                    In fact, what I love the most about programming is how it can apply to most things we do in life.
                    Among other things, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, playing boardgames, and reading fiction.
                    Some of these hobbies inspired many of the projects I've worked on, so don't forget to take a look at those!</p><br>
                <p>One of my biggest passions since high school has been playing volleyball.
                    I'm currently a member and secretary of the men's volleyball club at my school.
                    I also enjoy playing with people of all levels in RIT's intramural leagues.
                    I'm mostly an indoor volleyball player, but I recently started playing beach volleyball as well.
                    This opened up yet another way to stay active and meet amazing people who help me become a better team player.</p><br>
                <p>I've grown a particular interest towards the social aspects of coding.
                    I'm interested in how people come together to solve a problem through programming.
                    This interest has taken me to Hackathons around me, where I worked on one of the projects
                    showcased on this website</p><br>
                <p>In the past 3 years I've developed other small hobbies through different classes and clubs at RIT.
                    These include things likes playing the piano and gardening. I'm no expert in either of those things,
                    but I enjoy doing them and I have a feeling they'll become a bigger part of my life in the future.
                    </p><br>
                <p>My current career goals involve a mix of interests that I've developed in the past 3 years.
                    As a Computer Science major, I'm interested in solving problems through programming.
                    My minor in Mobile Development represents my interest in accessibility. Most people now have a
                    mobile device, which means mobile applications are among the best tools to host the solutions to
                    people's problems. Finally, my second minor in Computer Security shows my interest in and concern
                    for security. I want to make sure that the code I deliver is secure and trustworthy,
                    giving people one less thing to worry about.

                <h4>Towards an Affective Video Recommendation System</h4><br>

                <p>My 10-week participation in the Computational Sensing REU at RIT culminated with a paper we titled
                    "Towards an Affective Video Recommendation System." In this context, affective refers to data about
                    people's emotions. The goal of this project was to obtain affective data from subjects while they
                    watched video clips and later find a link between this data and how they rated the videos.</p><br>
                <p>We had people watch a series of 5 different videos meant to evoke different emotions while
                    their behaviour was beeing recorded by two webcams. We processed the stream from one webcam
                    through the Affectiva module in iMotions, a facial analysis software. Simultaneously, we used the
                    second webcam to estimate people's pulse through a technique known as photoplethysmography.</p><br>
                <p>For illustration purposes, we combined the facial analysis data with the pulse data into what we
                    called <em>Affective Graphs</em>. These graphs map the user's facial expressions and pulse as a function of
                    time. For more information, download my

                <h4>Job Search App</h4><br>

                <p>As part of a final project for my Mobile Design class, I designed and implemented a hybrid mobile
                    app to search for computing jobs. The app allows users to look for jobs through the Github Jobs
                    API. Users can search by keyword or by location. The app can also use your current location to look
                    for jobs around you.</p><br>

                <p>I used the Ionic framework to build this app. Ionic is a framework built on top of Cordova that allows
                    for a fast development of high-quality mobile apps using web technologies such as Angular, Typescript, HTML,
                    and SCSS. Cordova provides plugins that enable OS-specific functionality like Geolocation, which I
                    used in my app. Ionic provides the front-end and follows the Model-View-Controller pattern, separating
                    concerns and enforcing modular code.</p><br>

                <h4>BrickDash</h4><br>

                <p>BrickDash is a web implementation of the board game BalderDash.
                    This game is the product of 24 hours of work at RIT's BrickHack4 event, hence the name of the game.
                    Clever, right? My friends and I chose to work on this web application to avoid the constant paper
                    waste generated by the original game.</p><br>
                <p>We made the front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My main responsibility was the backend, which
                    I wrote in PHP. We hosted the site on a WAMP server I set up on my computer, which allowed us to test
                    it as we made progress.</p><br>
                <p>The web application allows for any number of players to join and play a game from their computers or
                    smartphones, completely removing the need for paper. Furthermore, it doesn't require user registration.
                    Instead, users can join each other by sharing a token provided by the game,
                    making for an easy-to-start experience.</p><br>

                <h4>Software Test Engineer at Rheonix </h4><br>

                <p>Rheonix is a medical devices company committed to improving standards of care by making molecular
                    diagnostics more accessible.</p><br>
                <p>As an FDA-regulated environment, this job required meticulous documentation and attention to details.
                    My main task consisted of writing and editing test protocols tracing to the software requirements
                    of the company's main product. I also identified and verified bugs in the software using Jira,
                    an issue-tracking tool.</p><br>
                <p>I helped assess the product's security through static code analysis to find common vulnerabilities.
                    I also documented and validated tools used by the software team in compliance with FDA standards.
                    Furthermore, I often took on side projects to help the mechanical team integrate and validate
                    various tools.
                    </p><br>

                <h4>REU Student Researcher at RIT</h4><br>

                <p>I worked with mentors from various disciplines on a 10-week long project as part of the Research
                    Experiences for Undergraduates program (REU) at RIT. My project's goal was to use facial and pulse
                    data to link people's emotions to how they rate videos online</p><br>
                <p>I designed the project with my mentors and wrote the software for the data collection process as
                    well as data analysis. I presented our work in progress at the 23rd Annual University at Buffalo
                    Undergraduate Research Conference as well the Undergraduate Research Symposium at RIT and other
                    locations.</p><br>
                <p>At the end of the program I delivered a final research paper with our findings.
                    This paper was submitted and accepted to the workshop on Human-Centered Computational Sensing (HCCS'18)
                    held in conjunction with the 16th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications
                    (PerCom'18)</p><br>

                <h4>Other Experiences</h4><br>

                <p>As a part time job, I work as an Intramural Supervisor for RIT Intramural Volleyball games.
                    I started as an Intramural Official in August 2015 and became a Supervisor in January 2017.
                    My job is to officiate games and train and supervise new Intramural Officials.</p><br>

                <p>In August 2016 I became a Student Lab Instructor for introductory Computer Science Courses.
                    For three semesters I guided students through problem solving sessions, held hours at the
                    Computer Science tutoring center, and graded weekly lab assignments.</p><br>
