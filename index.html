                <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2><br>
                <p>If you want to know things about me that are beyond the scope of my resume, you've come to the right place.
                    I won't try to explain my personality in a few words. People are too complex for that.
                    Instead, I'll tell you what I enjoy doing.</p><br>
                <p>I enjoy programming, but I also enjoy doing many other things.
                    In fact, what I love the most about programming is how it can apply to most things we do in life.
                    Among other things, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, playing boardgames, and reading fiction.
                    Some of these hobbies inspired many of the projects I've worked on, don't forget to take a look at those!</p><br>
                <p>One of my biggest passions since high school has been playing volleyball.
                    I'm currently a member and secretary of the men's volleyball club at my school.
                    I also enjoy playing with people of all levels in RIT's intramural leagues.
                    I'm mostly an indoor volleyball player, but I recently started playing beach volleyball as well.
                    This opened up yet another way to stay active and meet amazing people who help me become a better team player.</p><br>
                <p>I've grown a particular interest towards the social aspects of coding.
                    I'm interested in how people come together to solve a problem through programming.
                    This interest drove me into competitive coding sites likes CodeFights (See my profile).
                    The same interest has also taken me to Hackathons around me, where I worked on some of the projects
                    showcased on this website</p><br>
                <p>In the past 3 years I've developed other small hobbies through different classes and clubs at RIT.
                    These include things likes playing the piano and gardening. I'm no expert in either of those things,
                    but I enjoy doing them and I have a feeling they'll become a bigger part of my life in the future.
                    </p><br>
                <p>My current career goals involve a mix of interests that I've developed in the past 3 years.
                    As a Computer Science major, I'm interested in solving problems through programming.
                    My minor in Mobile Development represents my interest in accessibility. Most people use mobile devices
                    nowadays, which means mobile applications are among the best tools to host the solutions to people's problems.
                    Finally, my second minor in Computer Security shows my interest in and concern for security. I want
                    to make sure that the code I deliver is secure and trustworthy, giving people one less thing to
                    worry about.

                <h4>Software Test Engineer at Rheonix</h4><br>
                <p>As an FDA-regulated environment, this job required meticulous documentation and attention to details.
                    My main task consisted of writing and editing test protocols that would trace to the software requirements
                    of the company's main product. I also identified and verified bugs in the software using Jira,
                    an issue-tracking tool.</p><br>
                <p>I helped assess the product's security through static code analysis to find common
                    I also documented and validated tools used by the software team in compliance with FDA standards.
                    Furthermore, I often took on side projects to help the mechanical team integrate and validate
                    various tools.
