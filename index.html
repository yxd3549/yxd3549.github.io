            <p>If want to know things about me that are beyond my resume, you've come to the right place.
                I won't try to explain my personality in a few words. People are too complex for that.
                Instead, I'll tell you what I enjoy doing.</p><br>
            <p>I enjoy programming, but I also enjoy doing many other things.
                In fact, what I love the most about programming is how it can apply to most things we do in life.
                Among other things, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, playing boardgames, and reading fiction.
                Some of these hobbies inspired many of the projects I've worked on, don't forget to take a look at those!</p><br>
            <p>One of my biggest passion since high school has been playing volleyball.
                I'm currently a member and secretary of the men's volleyball club at my school.
                I also enjoy playing with people of all levels in RIT's intramural leagues.
                I'm mostly an indoor volleyball player, but I recently started playing beach volleyball as well.
                This opened up yet another way to stay active and meet amazing people who help me become a better teamplayer.</p><br>
            <p>I've grown a particular interest towards the social aspects of coding;
                I'm interested in how people come together to solve a problem through programming.
                This interest drove me into competitive coding sites likes CodeFights (See my profile).
                The same interest also takes me to Hackathons around me, where I worked on some of the projects
                showcased on this website</p><br>
            <p>I developed other small hobbies in the past 3 years through different classes and clubs.
                These include things likes playing the piano and gardening. I'm no expert in either of those things,
                but I enjoy doing them and I have a feeling they'll become a bigger part of my life in the future.
