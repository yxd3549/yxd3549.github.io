                <p>If you're here, that means you want to know more about me.
                    I enjoy programming, but I also enjoy doing many other things.
                    In fact, what I love the most about programming is how it can apply to most things we do in life.
                    Take a look at what I do when I am not staring at my computer!</p>

                <p>I started coding in 2015. Since then, I have been part of some very cool
                    projects. I have worked in Python, Java, and C. I also recently started learning
                    web design, which I allowed me to make this website from scratch! See a few of the
                    projects I have worked on since I started my career.</p>
